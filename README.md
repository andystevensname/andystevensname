# Hi :wave:. I'm Andy.

I'm a technical writer by day, and a writer/poet/dev by night. You'll see my hanging around the [Linode Docs](https://github.com/linode/docs) repo most of the time, but I do have a [personal website](https://github.com/andystevensname/andystevens.name) and a few other repos here. I've got more ideas for projects than time, to be honest.

I'm curious about a lot of technologies and will readily tell you I'm an expert in none of them. But, when it comes down to the code you see here it's mostly JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python.

Drop me a line if you want to collaborate! @andystevensname here and on that bird website.
